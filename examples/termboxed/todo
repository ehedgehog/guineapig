remove open panel, fixing up shelf/stack

horizontal scrolling 

TABS         
	tabs in the text should expand as necessary. Maybe
	the easiest thing to do is expand them on entry
	and compress on exit? That makes rather a lot of
	assumptions.

adjustments to marked range when newlines inserted/deleted.
	make marks a property of the buffer, since it knows when
	lines are removed/inserted, and in any case it will have
	to track other lines (or within lines)

display range bar even on empty lines (currently display
	is triggered when writing to the first rune of the line,
	but if there is no first rune, there's no display.)

the colour 'yellow' is more of a mucky orange. need lots of colours.
